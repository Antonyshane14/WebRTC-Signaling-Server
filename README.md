##  Quick Deploy to Railway

1. Click the Railway button above
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Select this repository
4. Railway will automatically detect and deploy!

##  Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Antonyshane14/SIGNALLING-SEVER.git
cd SIGNALLING-SEVER

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or start production server
npm start
```

##  API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```
Returns server status and connection statistics.

### Server Stats
```
GET /stats
```
Returns detailed server metrics including uptime and memory usage.

### Test Connection
```
GET /test
```
Simple test endpoint to verify server is responding.

### Root Endpoint
```
GET /
```
Returns server information and available endpoints.

##  Socket.IO Events

### Client Registration
```javascript
socket.emit('register', { userId: 'user123', name: 'John Doe' });
```

### Call Management
```javascript
// Initiate a call
socket.emit('call-request', { target: 'user456', offer: sdpOffer });

// Accept/reject call
socket.emit('call-response', { accepted: true, callerId: 'user123' });

// End call
socket.emit('end-call', { roomId: 'room123' });
```

### WebRTC Signaling
```javascript
// Send SDP offer
socket.emit('offer', { roomId: 'room123', offer: sdpOffer });

// Send SDP answer
socket.emit('answer', { roomId: 'room123', answer: sdpAnswer });

// Send ICE candidate
socket.emit('ice-candidate', { roomId: 'room123', candidate: iceCandidate });
```

##  Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port (Railway sets this automatically) |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Server host address |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Environment mode |

##  Production Deployment

### Railway Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect the Node.js environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Start the server with `npm start`
   - Assign a public URL

### Manual Railway Setup
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

##  Monitoring

The server provides comprehensive monitoring through several endpoints:

- **Health Status**: `/health` - Basic server health and client count
- **Detailed Stats**: `/stats` - Memory usage, uptime, and performance metrics
- **Connection Test**: `/test` - Simple connectivity verification

##  Security Features

- **CORS Protection**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on server termination
- **Connection Limits**: Built-in socket connection management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging

##  Performance

- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for fast startup
- **Scalable**: Designed for horizontal scaling
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time communication

## Client Integration

This server is compatible with:
- Flutter WebRTC applications
- Web browsers with WebRTC support
- React Native applications
- Native mobile apps
- Desktop applications

##  Auto-scaling

Railway automatically handles:
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale based on demand
- **Health Checks**: Automatic restart on failures
- **Zero-downtime**: Rolling deployments

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using the port
   lsof -i :3000
   
   # Kill the process
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure your client origin is allowed in CORS configuration
   - Check browser console for specific CORS errors

3. **Connection Timeouts**
   - Verify Railway environment variables
   - Check server logs for errors

### Debug Mode
```bash
DEBUG=socket.io* npm start
```
